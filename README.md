 Audio Processing and Conceptualisation of Rhythm classfier 

## Audio Processing in Matlab
- Matlab is widely used environment for signal processing and analysis. In this section, we introduce some key Matlab concepts and functions that are useful for music and audio. - If you have no previous experience with Matlab, it would be beneficial to go through some of the tutorials provided in the Matlab documentation.
- Matlab can be used to create and manipulate discrete-time signals.
- Individual expressions can be typed directly inside the Matlab interpreter. Collections of commands can be saved in text-files or scripts (with .m extensions) and then run from the command-line. Users can also write Matlab functions.
- Matlab operations are optimized for matrix algebra. Loops tend to execute more slowly.
- Matlab functions can be compiled as C executables to speed up performance (though you must purchase the compiler).
- Matlab is not free and its pricing structure is very complex.
- An open-source alternative to Matlab called Octave is available.
> Useful functions: size, abs, sum, plot, axis, stem, fft, ifft, grid, ...
